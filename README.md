# Food101 Image Classification Project
This project involves developing an image classification model using the VGG16 architecture with transfer learning. The main steps include data loading and preprocessing, model setup, and training. The project leverages Keras and TensorFlow libraries to achieve efficient classification of food images into 15 different categories.

# Features 
Data loading and preprocessing from a ZIP file.

Utilization of the VGG16 pre-trained model for transfer learning.

Custom model building with additional layers for classification.

Model compilation with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.

Training with early stopping and model checkpoint callbacks.

# Usage 
Unzip the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.

Run the script to train the model on the food101 dataset.

Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set.
